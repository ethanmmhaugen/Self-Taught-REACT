# Learning React

The purpose of this repo is just to document the process of teaching myself REACT through tutorials and practice. The long-term goal is to become good enough to pair with my backend skills and create a full stack web app. A shorter-term goal is just to create a portfolio website for myself. I plan to list out resources I come across and review them as I go, creating a map for others who want to become better with REACT.
